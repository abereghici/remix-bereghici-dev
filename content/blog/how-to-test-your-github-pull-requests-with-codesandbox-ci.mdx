If you're an open source project maintainer or you plan to create one, you
should consider using CodeSandbox CI in your project configuration. CodeSandbox
CI it's an awesome GitHub application that auto-builds your open source project
from pull requests. This can save a lot of time and effort to test and approve
the changes.

#### How it works?

Whenever someone opens a new pull request, CodeSandbox CI builds a new version
of your project. Those builds get posted to CodeSandbox registry, so you can
test it in there or locally, and all without having to publish the build to
npm⁠.

#### How do I set this up?

Let's create a demo project to see CodeSandbox CI in action. For that, create a
new project on GitHub and name it, for example, `codesandbox-ci-test`. Clone it
locally and add a `package.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "codesandbox-ci-test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=12"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "kcd-scripts build"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "kcd-scripts": "^11.2.2",
    "react": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.16.0"
  }
}
```

This is a standard package.json file for a JavaScript project. We'll be using
`kcd-scripts` to build our project, and we'll be using `react` to create a small
reusable component for this demo. `@babel/runtime` is required by `kcd-scripts`,
otherwise it won't build the project.

In `src/index.js` create a simple Counter component:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times!!!</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Install the CodeSandbox Github application from
[https://github.com/apps/codesandbox](https://github.com/apps/codesandbox) in
our new repository.

Create a file called `ci.json` in a folder called `.codesandbox` in the root of
the repository and add:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "build",
  "node": "12",
  "sandboxes": ["/cra-template"]
}
```

- `buildCommand` indicates which script in `package.json` should run to build
  the project.
- `node` is the Node.js version to use for building the PR.
- `sandboxes` is the list of sandboxes that we want to be generated. The default
  value is `vanilla`.

We don't want to use a default sandbox, because we'll have to modify manually
the sandbox code, to import and display the Counter component. Instead, we'll
create a custom template, named `cra-template`.

Create a new folder named `cra-template`, inside of this folder create a
`package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "react-starter-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "React example starter project",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "7.13.8",
    "typescript": "4.1.3"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "browserslist": [">0.2%", "not dead", "not ie <= 11", "not op_mini all"]
}
```

Create a `src` folder and a `index.js` file with:

```jsx
import {StrictMode} from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Counter from 'codesandbox-ci-test'

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <Counter />
  </StrictMode>,
  rootElement,
)
```

Create a `public` folder with a `index.html` file with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
    />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript> You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. </noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

At this point we can create a new pull request and see our configuration in
action. The CodeSandbox CI app will build the project and will leave a comment
on the pull request.
