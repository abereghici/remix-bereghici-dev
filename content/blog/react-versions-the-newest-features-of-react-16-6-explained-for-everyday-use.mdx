We’re living in pretty eventful times for React. Late December 2018 saw the
release of version 16.7 which included an important performance bugfix for
“React.lazy”. But, no other API (application programming interface) changes were
delivered.

For that reason, I’m doing a deep dive into React version 16.6, released in
October 2018, just a few days before [React Day](https://reactday.berlin/) in
Berlin.

As a developer attending a conference, I expect to get practical and technical
content as well as network with other developers dealing with the same
challenges as me. Fortunately for me, React Day Berlin jam packed immersive
learning and networking experience for frontend engineers working with React
into a one-day event. I managed to make new friends, share knowledge and learn
new things about React that I could immediately put into practice.

As I stood there, sharing the room with some of the most fascinating developers’
minds in the world I let myself be inspired and made my decision there. I can
now (officially) call myself a React aficionado, eager to tinker and test out
any new features. So, once they were released, I did just that — and I’m going
to lay it all out for you now. The good and the bad.

React 16.6 version is a minor release with major features focused on performance
optimization. The main new features are:

- React.memo()
- React.lazy()
- static contextType()
- static getDerivedStateFromError()

#### React.memo()

Function components are convenient when you don’t need to manage state but the
lack of lifecycle methods especially shouldComponentUpdate, means that your
component is always going to re-render.

Similar to React.PureComponent, React.memo() is a higher order component that
allows you to skip re-renders when props doesn’t change:

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(function (props) {})
```

#### React.lazy()

As your application grows in functionality, the bundle size also grows in size
and sometimes, being lazy is a smart choice. React.lazy() feature allows you to
load your components on demand, aka lazy loading.

```jsx
import {lazy} from 'react'
const MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'))
```

React.lazy() can be combined with Suspense, that will display a fallback
component while the dynamic component is being loaded.

```jsx
import {lazy, Suspense} from 'react'

const MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'))
function Application() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
      <MyLazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

#### static contextType()

React Context allows for parent components to pass data to their children, no
matter how deep the component tree is. Usually, this is the use case for using
Redux or Flux, but when you don’t need complex data management, React Context is
a good choice.

Starting with React 16.6 is easier to consume the context value anywhere within
class components:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static contextType = MyContext
  render() {
    let value = this.context
    /* render something based on the context value */
  }
}
```

You can reference the context in any of the lifecycle methods including the
render function. Keep in mind, this method only allows you to consume one
context.

#### static getDerivedStateFromError()

Error boundaries were introduced in React 16.3 and allow us to catch errors in
our components and prevent the application from crashing.

React 16.6 introduced a new lifecycle method called getDerivedStateFromError.
This method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.
It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and should return a value
to update the state providing a method to handle the error.

componentDidCatch should be used for side-effects like logging errors.

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = {hasError: false}
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return {hasError: true}
  }
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    logComponentStackToMyService(info.componentStack)
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>
    }
    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

#### React Hooks

At React Day Berlin, the coding community celebrated the introduction of an
awesome feature called Hooks! Although still in its testing phase, we discussed
this functionality at length.

Currently, there are some problems with the way we write React components. Our
components are simple and short in the beginning, but finished with huge
components — complicated logic spread around the constructor, methods and within
the lifecycle methods. Another problem is the lack of states in functional
components. If we want to use React features like context, states & lifecycle
methods we need to convert a functional component into a class component.

Hooks are designed to fix these issues by adding the option to use state,
context & lifecycle methods in a functional component. This means we’ll no
longer be forced to create class components and we can avoid the boilerplate
code we have to write when using classes. Also, React Hooks are a good
alternative to reuse some logic that comes with a much easier to understand
syntax and logic flow.

#### So, why do I love React so much?

As a front-end developer, I love trying new things: frameworks, libraries —
anything to make my job more efficient deserves my attention. I’ve created
several projects using Angular and was quite happy with it, but Angular is a
full-blown framework. It takes care of everything — HTTP, code structure,
application architecture, so we are forced color inside their proverbial coding
lines.

In contrast, React allows freedom. It comes with a different approach and
philosophy to creating front-end. I prefer solutions where I can pick and choose
the libraries that best fit the requirements of my app.

I love React because of its community. There is no shortage on tutorials for how
to learn using it, write components, how to route, etc.

The React ecosystem is focused on developer experience and productivity. The
community has created an impressive number of tools that help everyone write
better code. Redux, React Router & Immutable.js are just a few examples.

My list of reasons behind choosing React for front-end can go on, but these are
the main behind my choice to use this library.
