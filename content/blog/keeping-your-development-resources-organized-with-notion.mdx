As a developer, I have a lot of learning resources and I quickly realized that
keeping stuff in my browser's bookmark doesn't work for me. I needed a tool to
keep everything in one place. I started to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
and it didn't disappoint me. In this article I want to share how I structured
all my resources using this tool.

## Structure

This is how my notion "homepage" looks like. I divided the articles and
tutorials in different sections.

/>

Each section is divided in subsections. This allows me to keep the resources
related to one topic and it helps me find things faster.

## Bookmarks

Each subsection has a database where I store the bookmarks related to this
specific topic. I'm using
[Save to Notion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm?hl=en)
chrome extension to bookmark my links. The benefits of keeping the bookmarks in
Notion are that you can add tags, notes, filter or sort them by different
criteria.

## Task List

The importance of practice in programming cannot be ignored. "Practice makes a
man perfect", they said. Often, just reading a tutorial or a book is not enough,
you have to get your hands dirty with that specific technology / pattern /
language / whatever you learned. In the task list I define small side-projects
or things I need to practice. This is a great way to assess the progress.

## Reading list

The Reading list is my collection of books. I found that taking notes while
reading a book helps me process the information better. Also, I like being able
to go back and search my notes and quickly find the most essential information
from books I've read.

## Saved Tweets

A majority of the most valuable information I consume online comes from tweets
and threads. The goal is to keep everything in one place and hopefully there is
a boot named [Save To Notion](https://twitter.com/SaveToNotion) that can save
the tweets or threads directly in your notion by tagging the bot on that
specific tweet.

## RSS Feed

I bookmarked many useful blogs, but it was annoying to open each link manually
to see if there is new content. A common way to follow the new content is using
RSS feeds. Unfortunately, Notion doesn't provide this functionality. I solved
this problem by creating a small application with Rust that allows you to manage
the RSS sources in a separate notion page and daily reads the new content from
your sources and saves them in a notion feed. The project and the setup
instructions can be found here:
[https://github.com/abereghici/notion-feed.rs](https://github.com/abereghici/notion-feed.rs)

This is how looks the RSS sources:

This is the RSS feed:

## Conclusion

Notion is a great and flexible tool that can increase your productivity. It
comes with a lot of templates that can cover all your needs. If you find another
useful use-cases, share with us in the comments.
