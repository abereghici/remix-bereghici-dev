#### TL;DR

If you're interested in just see the code, you can find it here:
[https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate](https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate)

If you want to see an example with Rush used in a real, large project, you can
look at [ITwin.js](https://github.com/imodeljs/imodeljs), an open-source project
developed by Bentley Systems.

In previous posts, we added `prettier` and `eslint` to format our code and
enforce a consistent code style across our projects. We can save time by
automatically formatting pasted code, or fix `lint` errors while writing code,
without running lint command to see all the errors.

VSCode provides two different types of settings:

- User Settings - applied to all VSCode instances
- Workspace Settings - applied to the current project only.

We'll use Workspace Settings and few extensions to improve our development
experience in VSCode.

#### Install extensions

Let's add Prettier Formatter for VSCode. Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P),
paste the following command, and press enter.

```bash
ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode
```

or you can open
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
and install it manually.

In the same manner, let's install VSCode ESLint extension:

```bash
ext install dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
```

or install manually from
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

#### Add settings

Create a new file `.vscode/settings.json` in the root of our monorepo and let's
add the following settings:

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/node_modules": true,
    "**/.nyc_output": true,
    "**/.rush": true
  },
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/.nyc_output": true,
    "**/.rush": true,
    "**/*.build.log": true,
    "**/*.build.error.log": true,
    "**/generated-docs": true,
    "**/package-deps.json": true,
    "**/test-apps/**/build": true
  },
  "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "typescript",
    "typescriptreact"
  ],

  "eslint.workingDirectories": [
    {
      "mode": "auto"
    }
  ],
  "eslint.nodePath": "common/temp/node_modules",
  "eslint.trace.server": "verbose",
  "eslint.options": {
    "resolvePluginsRelativeTo": "node_modules/@monorepo/eslint-config"
  },
  "eslint.format.enable": true,
  "eslint.lintTask.enable": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "editor.action.fixAll": true,
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

In these settings we:

- set Prettier as default formatter
- exclude from search some irrelevant folders like `node_modules` and
  `.nyc_output`
- exclude from VSCode file explorer irrelevant files
- provide a nodePath for ESLint. We're not using `eslint` directly (we're using
  `lint` script from `react-scripts`) so we're helping the extension to find the
  `eslint` binary.
- provide a path to `eslint` plugins. We're helping ESLint extension to pick up
  the right rules for each project.

I hope you'll find these settings useful.
