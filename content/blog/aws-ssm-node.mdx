SSM (Systems Manager) is a service provided by AWS that allows you to securely
store and retrieve data for your application (amongst other things). This can be
environment based connection urls, authentication credentials, or properties
youâ€™d like to change without needing a re-deploy of your application.

In SSM you can store strings, list of strings and encrypted strings. Also, you
can store as JSON and later serialize it to a javascript object.

```javascript
import SSM from 'aws-sdk/clients/ssm'

const ssm = new SSM()

export async function loadParameter(parameterName: string) {
  try {
    const {Parameter} = await ssm
      .getParameter({
        Name: `/your/namespace/${parameterName}`,
        WithDecryption: true,
      })
      .promise()

    return Parameter?.Value ?? null
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
    return null
  }
}
```
