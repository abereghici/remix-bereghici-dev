#### TL;DR

If you're interested in just see the code, you can find it here:
[https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate](https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate)

If you want to see an example with Rush used in a real, large project, you can
look at [ITwin.js](https://github.com/imodeljs/imodeljs), an open-source project
developed by Bentley Systems.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) allows you to configure the deployment of
your project directly on their dashboard using a build command. This works well
when you have a project in a single repository and you don't need to deploy it
very often. They give you a free plan which includes only 300 free build
minutes. On the other hand, Github Actions is more flexible and they give you
2000 free build minutes. Also, you can run various tasks like "testing",
"linting", "deployment", etc.

#### Create a Netlify site

- Create an account if you don't have one yet on Netlify and create a new site.
- Go to the project settings and copy the API ID.
- Open Github repository and go to the settings of the repository.
- Click on "Secrets" and add a new secret with the name `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` and
  paste the copied API ID from Netlify.
- Go back to Netlify dashboard and open user settings.
  [https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens)
- Click on "Applications" and create a new access token.
- Open Github "Secrets" and create a new secret with the name
  `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and paste the new access token created on Netlify.

#### Create Github Actions workflow

At this point, we have all credentials we need for deployment. Now, we can start
writing our configurations.

We need to add two more commands in `common/rush/command-line.json`: `lint` and
`test`. We'll trigger them on CI/CD before building the project.

In `common/rush/command-line.json` add the following:

```json
    {
      "name": "test",
      "commandKind": "bulk",
      "summary": "Run tests on each package",
      "description": "Iterates through each package in the monorepo and runs the 'test' script",
      "enableParallelism": true,
      "ignoreMissingScript": true,
      "ignoreDependencyOrder": true,
      "allowWarningsInSuccessfulBuild": true
    },
    {
      "name": "lint",
      "commandKind": "bulk",
      "summary": "Run linter on each package",
      "description": "Iterates through each package in the monorepo and runs the 'lint' script",
      "enableParallelism": true,
      "ignoreMissingScript": true,
      "ignoreDependencyOrder": true,
      "allowWarningsInSuccessfulBuild": false
    }
```

In the root of monorepo, create a `.github/workflows` folder and create a new
file named `main.yml`.

```shell
mkdir -p .github/workflows

touch .github/workflows/main.yml
```

Now, let's write the configurations for Github Actions.

```yaml
# Name of workflow
name: Main workflow

# When workflow is triggered

  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:

      # Run rush install

        run: |
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js change -v

        app-name: [react-app]
        include:
          - app-name: react-app
            app: '@monorepo/react-app'
            app-dir: 'apps/react-app'
            app-build: 'apps/react-app/build'
            site-id: NETLIFY_SITE_ID

        with:

      # Run rush install and build on our code
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |

          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js install
      - name: Build ${{ matrix.app-name }}
        working-directory: ${{ matrix.app-dir }}
        run: |
          node $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/common/scripts/install-run-rush.js build --verbose --to ${{ matrix.app }}
      - name: Deploy ${{ matrix.app-name }}
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1.2
        with:
          publish-dir: ${{ matrix.app-build }}
          production-deploy: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          enable-pull-request-comment: true
          enable-commit-comment: true
          overwrites-pull-request-comment: true
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets[matrix.site-id] }}
```

Let's break down the configuration above.

We have 3 jobs: `lint`, `test` and `deploy`. `lint` and `test` jobs will run in
parallel and `deploy` job will run after both `lint` and `test` jobs are
successfully done. We're using matrix to run jobs on different NodeJS versions
(Currently we're using only `14.x` but can be extended to other versions).
Matrix is also used to run the same build steps for multiple projects. At the
moment, we have only `react-app` project, but it can be easily extended.

We're running this workflow when the `master` branch is modified. For pull
requests, Netlify will provide preview urls, but if we push something directly
to `master` branch, it will trigger a `production` build and the code will be
deployed to the main url.

The main workflow we created is mostly suitable for development / staging
environments. For production, you probably want to trigger the flow manually and
create a `git tag`. You can create another site in Netlify, create a
`PRODUCTION_NETLIFY_SITE_ID` secret in Github and use the following
configuration:

```yaml
name: React App Production Deployment
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: Bump Version
        default: v1.0.0
        required: true
      git-ref:
        description: Git Ref (Optional)
        required: false
# Jobs to carry out
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Get code from repo
      - name: Clone Repository (Latest)
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: github.event.inputs.git-ref == ''
      - name: Clone Repository (Custom Ref)
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: github.event.inputs.git-ref != ''
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.git-ref }}
      # Install NodeJS
      - name: Use Node.js 14.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14.x
      # Run rush install and build on our code
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js change -v
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js install
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js build
      # Run eslint to check all packages
      - name: Lint packages
        run: node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js lint
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CI: true
    steps:
      # Get code from repo
      - name: Clone Repository (Latest)
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: github.event.inputs.git-ref == ''
      - name: Clone Repository (Custom Ref)
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: github.event.inputs.git-ref != ''
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.git-ref }}
      # Install NodeJS
      - name: Use Node.js 14.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14.x
      # Run rush install
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js change -v
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js install
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js build
      # Run unit tests for all packages
      - name: Run tests
        run: node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js test
  deploy:
    # Operating system to run job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, test]
    # Steps in job
    steps:
      # Get code from repo
      - name: Clone Repository (Latest)
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: github.event.inputs.git-ref == ''
      - name: Clone Repository (Custom Ref)
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: github.event.inputs.git-ref != ''
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.git-ref }}
      # Install NodeJS
      - name: Use Node.js 14.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14.x
      # Run rush install and build on our code
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js change -v
          node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js install
      # Build app
      - name: Build react app
        working-directory: apps/react-app
        run: |
          node  $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/common/scripts/install-run-rush.js build --verbose --to @monorepo/react-app
      - name: Deploy react app
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1.2
        with:
          publish-dir: apps/react-app/build
          production-deploy: true
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          enable-pull-request-comment: true
          enable-commit-comment: true
          overwrites-pull-request-comment: true
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
      # Create release tag
      - name: Create tag
        run: |
          git tag ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          git push origin --tags
```

Now we can trigger a production deploy manually for `react-app` project. We can
provide the next version number as a `version` parameter and it will create a
tag for us. If we want to revert to a previous version, you can also do it by
providing a `git-ref`.

If you encountered any issues during the process, you can see the code related
to this post [here](https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate).

If you're using VSCode, you might be interested to see some configurations that
can enrich your development experience with this monorepo. See the
