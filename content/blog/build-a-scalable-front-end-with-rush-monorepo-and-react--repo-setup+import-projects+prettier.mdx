In a multi-repository project structure, it's only a matter of time when you'll
need to reuse some code from one project to another. Adopting a monorepo
architecture can help the team share and contribute code in a simple manner. I
won't cover in this article the pros and cons of choosing this approach, because
there are plenty of resources that debate this topic, instead, I'll focus on the
implementation of a scalable monorepo using Rush.js and React.

### Tools

We'll be using the following tools:

- [Rush](https://rushjs.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Goals

Before implementing the monorepo, let's define the goals we want to achieve
using these tools:

- Multiple applications
- Code sharing between applications
- Shared tools and configurations
- Enforced rules for code quality
- Automated workflow for development

### TL;DR

If you're interested in just see the code, you can find it here:
[https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate](https://github.com/abereghici/rush-monorepo-boilerplate)

If you want to see an example with Rush used in a real, large project, you can
look at [ITwin.js](https://github.com/imodeljs/imodeljs), an open-source project
developed by Bentley Systems.

### Guide

#### Create a new repository

I assume you already created an empty Github repository for this project. Let's
clone it locally and let the magic begin!

#### Initialize the rush monorepo

Inside of your project folder, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/rush

rush init
```

After this command, you'll see a bunch of files and folders created. You can
check the config files reference
[here](https://rushjs.io/pages/advanced/config_files/).

At this point, we can remove unnecessary files and create our first commit.

```bash
rm -rf .travis.yml

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
```

#### Import existing projects without loosing git history

You don't really want to perform a migration to monorepo if you lose all the
history of your projects. If everything will point to the commit where you
merged the projects, you won't be able to revert to the previous commits, or run
`git blame` or `git bisect`.

We can copy all projects inside of the monorepo and keep the git history of each
project with a single git command: `git subtree`.

Let's suppose we want to import the following project into our monorepo
[https://github.com/abereghici/react-app](https://github.com/abereghici/react-app).
We'll do it using the command `git subtree add`

```bash
git subtree add --prefix apps/react-app \
 https://github.com/abereghici/react-app master
```

Let's decode the parameters of this command:

- `apps/react-app` is used to specify the path inside of the monorepo where the
  project will be imported.
- `https://github.com/abereghici/react-app` is the remote repository URL of the
  project we want to import.
- `master` is the branch from where the project will be imported.

Now if you run `git log` you'll see the history of `react-app` project inside of
our monorepo.

Open `apps/react-app/package.json` and change the name of the project with
`@monorepo/react-app`.

The last step is to register `@monorepo/react-app` project in rush configuration
file. Open `rush.json` file and add an entry like this under the projects
inventory:

```json
 "projects": [
    {
      "packageName": "@monorepo/react-app",
      "projectFolder": "apps/react-app",
      "reviewCategory": "production"
    }
  ]
```

This tells to Rush that it should manage this project. Next, run `rush update`
to install the dependencies of `react-app` project. This command can be launched
in any subfolder of the repo folder that contains `rush.json` file.

```bash
rush update
git add .
git commit -m "Imported react-app project"
git push origin master
```

#### Adding Prettier

We want to have consistent syntax and formatting across all code files in our
monorepo. So we'll apply Prettier globally for the entire repository. We'll run
it during `git commit`.

Let's create a configuration file in the root of the repo. Prettier allows many
different names for this config file, but we'll use `.prettierrc.js`

**`<repo root>/.prettierrc.js`**

```js
module.exports = {
  arrowParens: 'avoid',
  bracketSpacing: true,
  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',
  insertPragma: false,
  jsxBracketSameLine: false,
  jsxSingleQuote: false,
  printWidth: 80,
  proseWrap: 'preserve',
  quoteProps: 'as-needed',
  requirePragma: false,
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: true,
  tabWidth: 2,
  trailingComma: 'es5',
  useTabs: false,
}
```

You also need to make a `.prettierignore` file to tell Prettier which files to
skip. It is recommended for `.prettierignore` to extend the same patterns used
in `.gitignore`.

```bash
cp .gitignore .prettierignore
```

Once the configuration is set up, next we need to invoke Prettier manually to
reformat all the existing source files.

```bash
# See what files Prettier will format
# check the output and modify .prettierignore rules if needed
npx prettier . --list-different

# When you are ready, this will format all the source files
npx prettier . --write
```

To speed up the prettier process on `git commit` hook, we'll use
`prettier-quick` to calculate the subset of files that are staged for commit and
format them.

Let's create a rush auto-installer, where we'll list all dependencies for
formatting.

```bash
# This creates the common/autoinstallers/rush-prettier/package.json file:
rush init-autoinstaller --name rush-prettier
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash

cd common/autoinstallers/rush-prettier

# Install the dependencies.
# You can also manually edit the "dependencies" in the package.json file
 pnpm install prettier
 pnpm install pretty-quick

# update the auto-installer
rush update-autoinstaller --name rush-prettier

```

Next, we will create a rush prettier custom command that invokes the
`pretty-quick` tool. Add this to the "commands" section of
`config/rush/command-line.json` file:

```json

  . . .
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "prettier",
      "commandKind": "global",
      "summary": "Used by the pre-commit Git hook. This command invokes Prettier to reformat staged changes.",
      "safeForSimultaneousRushProcesses": true,

      "autoinstallerName": "rush-prettier",

      // This will invoke common/autoinstallers/rush-prettier/node_modules/.bin/pretty-quick
      "shellCommand": "pretty-quick --staged"
    }
    . . .

```

After saving these changes, let’s test our custom command by running
`rush prettier`.

The last step is to add a Git hook that invokes rush prettier automatically
whenever `git commit` is performed. Let's create a file called `pre-commit` in
the `common/git-hooks` folder:

**`common/git-hooks/pre-commit`**

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.

# Invoke the "rush prettier" custom command to reformat files whenever they
# are committed. The command is defined in common/config/rush/command-line.json
# and uses the "rush-prettier" autoinstaller.
node common/scripts/install-run-rush.js prettier || exit $?
```

Install the hook by running `rush install`.

We're done! Now on every commit we'll be automatically prettified.
