Hey, my name is Alexandru Bereghici. I'm a software engineer based in Chisinau,
Republic of Moldova 🇲🇩. I've been working on the web professionally since 2015
and unprofessionally since 2010 when I created my first website.

This site it's a place where I can explore new ideas, experiment with different
technologies, and spread knowledge.
